# A-Web-based-Platform-for-Server-Log-Analytics
<p>Web log analysis is a kind of web analytics software that parses a server logfile from a web server, and based on the values contained in the log file, derives indicators about when, how, and by whom a web server is visited. It will give you information about your site's visitors: activity statistics, accessed files, paths through the site, information about referring pages, search engines, browsers, operating systems, and more. The program produces easy-to-read reports that include both text information (tables) and charts.</p>
